# CoWin-Slots-Alert
In this programme we are trying to fetch data from cowin.gov.in and show those data in our application with a single click and thus you can be alert when the slots are available in nearby vaccination centers !

cowin is a India based webapp where user basically takes appointment for Covid vaccine. User selects the areal pin code or district and select his/her age then all the available vaccination centers are displayed on the screen datewise on that particular area of which the user has given pincode.
